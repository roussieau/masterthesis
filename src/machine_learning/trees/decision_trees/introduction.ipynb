    "Principle : Imagine you want to distinguish between the following four animals: bears, hawks, penguins, and dolphins. Your goal is to get to the right answer by asking as few if/else questions as possible. You might start off by asking whether the animal has feathers, a question that narrows down your possible animals to just two. If the answer is “yes,” you can ask another question that could help you distinguish between hawks and penguins. For example, you could ask whether the animal can fly. If the animal doesn’t have feathers, your possible animal choices are dolphins and bears, and you will need to ask a question to distinguish between these two animals—for example, asking whether the animal has fins."
