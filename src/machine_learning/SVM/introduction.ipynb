    "Principle : Kernelized support vector machines (often just referred to as SVMs) are an extension that allows for more complex mod‐ els that are not defined simply by hyperplanes in the input space. One way to make a linear model more flexible is by adding more features—for example, by adding interactions or polynomials of the input features.\n",
    "However, often we don’t know which features to add, and adding many features might make computation very expensive. *Kernel trick* : works by directly computing the distance (i.e. the scalar products) of the data points for the expanded feature representation, without ever actually computing the expansion.\n",
    "There are two ways to map your data into a higher-dimensional space that are com‐ monly used with support vector machines: the polynomial kernel, which computes all possible polynomials up to a certain degree of the original features (like feature1 ** 2 * feature2 ** 5); and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, also known as the Gaussian kernel."
